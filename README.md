#ChatPdf
In today's digital age, efficiently extracting and interacting with information from documents is paramount. Imagine an application that allows users to upload a PDF, ask questions via audio, and receive precise answers derived from the document's content. This fusion of natural language processing and speech recognition offers a seamless user experience. In this blog, we'll explore the development of such an application using Streamlit, Deepgram, and ChatGroq.
##Overview
The application enables users to:
Upload a PDF document.
Pose questions through audio input.
Receive answers based on the PDF's content.

This is achieved by extracting text from the PDF, transcribing the audio input to text, and utilizing a language model to generate responses.
##Technologies Used
Streamlit: A Python library for creating interactive web applications.
Deepgram: A speech-to-text API for transcribing audio inputs.
ChatGroq: A language model for generating human-like responses.
PyPDF2: A library for extracting text from PDF files.
SentenceTransformer: For handling text embeddings.

##Implementation Steps
###Setting Up the Environment:
Install the necessary libraries:

pip install streamlit deepgram-sdk PyPDF2 sentence-transformers
Ensure you have API keys for Deepgram and ChatGroq.

3.Extracting Text from PDFs:
Use PyPDF2 to read and extract text from each page of the PDF.
To manage large documents, divide the text into manageable chunks, ensuring each chunk stays within token limits for processing.

4. Transcribing Audio Input:
Utilize Deepgram's API to convert audio questions into text format.

5. Generating Responses:
Combine the extracted PDF text and the transcribed question to form a prompt.
Use ChatGroq to generate a response based on this prompt.

6. Building the Streamlit Interface:
Create an intuitive interface allowing users to upload PDFs and record their questions.
Display the transcribed question and the generated answer.

Challanges and Solutions
Token Limitations: When dealing with extensive PDFs, sending the entire text to the language model can exceed token limits, leading to errors. To mitigate this:
Summarize or chunk the PDF content into smaller sections.
Process each chunk individually and aggregate the results.
Audio Quality: Ensure that the audio input is clear to improve transcription accuracy.

Conclusion
By integrating Streamlit, Deepgram, and ChatGroq, we've developed an application that offers an interactive way to query PDF documents using voice input. This approach enhances user engagement and accessibility, providing a practical solution for efficient information retrieval from documents.
